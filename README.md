Printtboard USB Support Bracket

How It All Began
----------------

I have a PrintrBot Play which had purchased around the beginning of 2016. I absolutely love it! however a few weeks into owning it, the USB port on the Printrboard Rev F2 (main control board) seems to have succumbed to gravity and... fell off. I did remember reading about the that port being a problem for some people and so i had been really careful with it. Likely that my particular Printerboard had a mechanical issue. 

Now i really like the PrintrBoard and the Printrbot people (who got a new one for me under warranty in no time) and I have a Rev D that I use in my RepRap Air. I decided that i could probably help solve this problem and downloaded the CAD drawings of the board. I designed this little support bracket, and its been working for more than a month with no problems! It even 'feels' more stable. It take no time to print and very little PLA even with a solid infill. You will need a slightly longer M4 mounting screw (I found an M4x12 at my local ACE hardware that worked nicely) to accommodate the bracket.

I did the design in Fusion 360 (Link Below). Please Download, Use, Modify, Improve and Remix. 3D Printing has a great user and manufacturer community and I'm glad to be a part of it!
